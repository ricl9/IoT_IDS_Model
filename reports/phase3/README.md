# Phase 3: Flow-level Supervised Refinement (placeholder)

Planned steps:
- Generate imbalanced flow-level dataset.
- Join flagged packets to flows; aggregate split segments (<=2 min) per flow key.
- Train supervised classifier to refine alerts across 6 classes.
- Evaluate reduction in false positives and per-class performance.
